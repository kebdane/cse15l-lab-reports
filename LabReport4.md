# Lab Report 4 - Vim

### Step 4
Keys pressed:

* `<up><enter>` - The `ssh kebdane@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 1 up in my search history, so I used up arrow to access it. 

### Step 5
Keys pressed:

* `git<space>clone<space>git@github.com:kebdane/lab7.git<enter>` - I used `git clone` with the ssh of my forked repository of `lab7` to clone the `lab7` repository.

### Step 6
Keys pressed:

* `cd<space>lab7<enter>` - I used `cd` command with `lab7` directory to change the current working directory into `lab7`

* `bash<space>test.sh<enter>` - I used `bash` with the file `test.sh` to run teh tests

### Step 7
Keys pressed:

* `vim<space>ListExamples.java<enter>` - I used `vim` with `ListExamples.java` to edit the file within the terminal

* `?index1` - I used `?` with "index1" to allow me to find the occurence of "index1" starting from the bottom of the file, and this allowed me to edit the bug quickly as it was at the bottom.

* `dw` - I used `dw` to delete from the current position of the cursor till the end of the current word, in this case this deleted "index1".

* `i` - I used `i` to be in insert mode and insert "index2" to replace "index1".

* `<esc>` - I pressed `<esc>` to go back to normal mode in Vim

* `:wq` - I pressed `:wq` to save my changes, using `w`, in the file and quit Vim using `q`.
