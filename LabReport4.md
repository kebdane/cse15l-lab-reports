# Lab Report 4 - Vim

```
Keys pressed: <up><enter> The ssh kebdane@ieng6.ucsd.edu command was 1 up in my search history, so I used up arrow to access it. Then the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ... command was 4 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.
